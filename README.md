This is my pre-last project for the Foundations of the Odin Project. I enjoy this course as it provides me with hands-on learning experience which I find very useful.

As a note to myself, I want to say that I hope to finish this course and then partake on Full-Stack Open, completing that apply for internships in the SDE industry.
